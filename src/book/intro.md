# Steam Explorer

Steam Explorer is an exploratory data-analysis project working with a self-gathered dataset sourced from the [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com) gaming platform, aggregating data on over 160,000 applications.
The project is currently in active development; some data is still being gathered, and much of the analysis is missing or not finalised. Come back in a couple weeks to see what's new!
