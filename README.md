## Data Gathering and Processing

Python scripts for data aggregation, preprocessing, processing, and database manipulation are stored in the `scripts` directory.
The scripts make use of a configuration file that must be initialised upon cloning the repo.
```
> py -m scripts.config
```

This configuration file specifies where the gathered data is to be saved or read from. It also specifies the directories for logging and script state. It is backed by the `scripts/config.json` file, which can be freely modified by the user. By default it has the values:
```json
{
    "root_dir": "<project-root>",
    "prefix_root": true,
    "data_dir": "data",
    "logs_dir": ".logs",
    "state_dir": ".state"
}
```
- If the `prefix_root` is set to `true`, then the `data_dir`, `logs_dir`, and `state_dir` paths are taken to be relative to the `root_dir` directory. If `prefix_root` is set to `false` then the directories are taken to be absolute paths, and `root_dir` is not used. This allows for the directories to be stored in different locations if wanted.

All the scripts are modules that make use of this configuration file, writing to files in the logs directory, using states stored in the states directory and manipulating data in the data directory. **Scripts can only be invoked from the project root**. Their functionality and required arguments can be accessed by passing in `-h` or `--help`:
```
> py -m scripts.gather.steam.store -h
usage: scripts.gather.steam.store [-h] -a {info,reviews} -n NUMBER [-s SLEEP] [-m MANUAL]

Calls the selected API and stores the relevant object block of the specified AppIDs to file.
Automatically checks saved state from previous calls in order to select starting AppID.
Uses `<DATA_DIR>/raw/applist/applist.dat` to get an ordered list of AppIDs.
Using the list, starting at the given AppID, processes `-n/--number` AppIDs.
Continues on unsuccessful API calls (no store page exists); aborts on any error.


options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a {info,reviews}, --api {info,reviews}
                        [enum] selects which API to call
  -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
                        [int] number of appids to process
  -s SLEEP, --sleep SLEEP
                        [float] seconds to sleep in between requests (default: 1.5)
  -m MANUAL, --manual MANUAL
                        [int] manually select start appid

IMPORTANT: Setting SLEEP < 1.5 with NUMBER > 200 requests will trigger an HTTP 429
```
